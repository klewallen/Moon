## Susceptibility to Transmissible Cancer
The independent 
and nearly concurrent genesis of DFT1 and DFT2 in the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) 
an intriguing target of genomic study. Why this species appears to be maladapted to 
recognizing invading foreign cells remains frustratingly unclear. 
Through comparative genomic approaches, I aim to identify patterns of divergence unique 
to the devil genome that could help explain its propensity to develop such persistent and infectious cancers.

## System background
Transmissible cancers are exceedingly rare. Canine venereal tumor disease is an ancient affliction in dogs, 
and recent studies have uncovered something similar in bivalves that is spread through their filter feeding. 
Yet in fewer than 20 years, a transmissible cancer has emerged twice in the same species - the Tasmanian devil. 
This is quite remarkable and it points to something very interesting, but as yet still undiscovered, in the devil genome. 
In most animals, cells from another individual are quickly recognized as non-self and attacked. 
But clearly something has happened in the evolutionary history of the Tasmanian devil that has hindered this basic immune function. 
The dramatic decline in wild devil populations makes this a pressing issue to disentangle.
